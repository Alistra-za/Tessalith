# DECISIONS archive

Rulings here are **not in force**. They moved verbatim from DECISIONS.md under their original IDs (docs/DOCUMENTATION.md §7). Never cite one as a reason for current behaviour.

This file holds 2.x rulings only. Rulings archived before 2.0 are in `.claude/DECISIONS-1.x.md` under `# Archived`.

## Note FM — Tessalith 2.0 (main team, 2026-11-02)

ARCHIVED (wording before the edit; superseded in part by Note GJ3, 2026-11-03)
- **FM27 GUI test seams sit behind a `test-hooks` feature (plan task 16, 2026-11-03).** No encoded byte changes and `identity.json` is untouched.
  - **The feature.** `sdc-gui` has a `test-hooks` feature, off by default. Its own dev-dependency (`sdc-gui = { path = ".", features = ["test-hooks"] }`, the engine's pattern, Note K) turns it on for `cargo test` and `--all-targets`; `cargo build --release` never enables it (resolver 2). `#[doc(hidden)]` is not used in `crates/gui/src`.
  - **The rule for a new seam.** A `pub` item that only tests use, and every counter, field or write that only such an item reads, is `#[cfg(feature = "test-hooks")]`. A production item that tests also call (`finish_cs_pbr`, `finish_cm_json`, `finish_xpmf`, `statics_of`, `apply_settings`, `uv.read`, `StatCache::clear`) stays plain `pub`. When a production path takes a test's replacement (the UV overlay's image builder), the production code calls a private function and the seam is a gated wrapper over it (`uv_overlay_job_with`).
  - **What is gated.** The counters and getters `filtered_builds`, `problems_builds`, `problem_lookups`, `export_files_builds`, `view_builds`, `set_cards_drawn`, `helper_rows_drawn`, `cache_builds`, `gen_lookups`, `header_reads_on_this_thread`, `plan_calls`, `uv_reads_on_this_thread`, `visible_builds`, `row_builds`, `project_builds` and `dds_thumb_requests`; the plan-hold hooks (`hold_plan_results`, `take_held`, `handle_held`, `end_export_with`); the Meshes pill-read gate (`project_gate`, `project_alive`, `project_started`, `hold_rows_read`); the Set 3D encoder and viewport stand-ins (`hold_workers`, `inject`, `inject_as`, `inject_stale`, `has_alt`, `token_of`, `alt_token_of`, `set_plugin_reader`, `attach_test_thread`, `fake_render_thread`, `reply_sender_for_test`, `render_sent_for_test`, `loaded_for_test`); and small getters (`votes_pending`, `generation`, `plan_marks`, `gen_dims_len`, `clear_gen_dims`, `gen_preview_opts`). A build without the feature does none of the counting.
  - **Tests.** Every test that reaches a seam runs under `cargo test -p sdc-gui`; `tools\doc-shots.ps1` runs `cargo test -p sdc-gui --test doc_shots`, so it gets the feature too. Gate: `cargo clippy -p sdc-gui -- -D warnings` (no feature) and `--all-targets` both pass.
  - Supersedes: tune-up #7 item 5 (the public test seams on `AppModel`; the tune-up list is outside the repo). In part: CL19, GC2 and GC11 (the `#[doc(hidden)]` wording).
