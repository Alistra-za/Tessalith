## Note FM — Tessalith 2.0 (main team, 2026-11-02)

ARCHIVED (wording before the edit; superseded in part by Note GJ3, 2026-11-03)
- **FM27 GUI test seams sit behind a `test-hooks` feature (plan task 16, 2026-11-03).** No encoded byte changes and `identity.json` is untouched.
  - **The feature.** `sdc-gui` has a `test-hooks` feature, off by default. Its own dev-dependency (`sdc-gui = { path = ".", features = ["test-hooks"] }`, the engine's pattern, Note K) turns it on for `cargo test` and `--all-targets`; `cargo build --release` never enables it (resolver 2). `#[doc(hidden)]` is not used in `crates/gui/src`.
  - **The rule for a new seam.** A `pub` item that only tests use, and every counter, field or write that only such an item reads, is `#[cfg(feature = "test-hooks")]`. A production item that tests also call (`finish_cs_pbr`, `finish_cm_json`, `finish_xpmf`, `statics_of`, `apply_settings`, `uv.read`, `StatCache::clear`) stays plain `pub`. When a production path takes a test's replacement (the UV overlay's image builder), the production code calls a private function and the seam is a gated wrapper over it (`uv_overlay_job_with`).
  - **What is gated.** The counters and getters `filtered_builds`, `problems_builds`, `problem_lookups`, `export_files_builds`, `view_builds`, `set_cards_drawn`, `helper_rows_drawn`, `cache_builds`, `gen_lookups`, `header_reads_on_this_thread`, `plan_calls`, `uv_reads_on_this_thread`, `visible_builds`, `row_builds`, `project_builds` and `dds_thumb_requests`; the plan-hold hooks (`hold_plan_results`, `take_held`, `handle_held`, `end_export_with`); the Meshes pill-read gate (`project_gate`, `project_alive`, `project_started`, `hold_rows_read`); the Set 3D encoder and viewport stand-ins (`hold_workers`, `inject`, `inject_as`, `inject_stale`, `has_alt`, `token_of`, `alt_token_of`, `set_plugin_reader`, `attach_test_thread`, `fake_render_thread`, `reply_sender_for_test`, `render_sent_for_test`, `loaded_for_test`); and small getters (`votes_pending`, `generation`, `plan_marks`, `gen_dims_len`, `clear_gen_dims`, `gen_preview_opts`). A build without the feature does none of the counting.
  - **Tests.** Every test that reaches a seam runs under `cargo test -p sdc-gui`; `tools\doc-shots.ps1` runs `cargo test -p sdc-gui --test doc_shots`, so it gets the feature too. Gate: `cargo clippy -p sdc-gui -- -D warnings` (no feature) and `--all-targets` both pass.
  - Supersedes: tune-up #7 item 5 (the public test seams on `AppModel`; the tune-up list is outside the repo). In part: CL19, GC2 and GC11 (the `#[doc(hidden)]` wording).

## Digest

ARCHIVED (superseded by Note FM, 2026-11-03)
- OPEN: `resize` upscaling (`pot-up`, `pot-nearest`). [S]

ARCHIVED (wording before the edit; superseded in part by Note FN, 2026-11-04)
- Anything the user must act on is a Problems row with its action; hand remedies are row buttons. [FC3, FC10]

ARCHIVED (wording before the edit; superseded in part by Note GQ, 2026-11-04)
- The visible list is cached; row reads never land across a scan start; chips wait for a settled store. [GC11, GC14, GC15]

ARCHIVED (wording before the edit; superseded in part by Note GQ, 2026-11-04)
- The edit panel's footer (`meshes-edit-export`, before the tab strip) shows a status line ("Ready", "Blocked: <reason>", idle "No edits to export."), "Writes <data path> to <export path>", the source-never-changed line and Review…; with no export folder it stays blocked with the reason. The button reads "Export NIF · N edits", "Export NIF" or "Export NIF again". [CZ2, CZ3, CZ8]

ARCHIVED (wording before the edit; superseded in part by Note GQ, 2026-11-04)
- `esp::mato_data` returns None for the whole plugin on any fault its walk reaches (bad group size, bad zlib, a subrecord past its record) and never clamps; the first record with at least 48 bytes of DATA wins. [GG11]

ARCHIVED (wording before the edit; superseded in part by Note GQ, 2026-11-04)
- The writer re-opens per op, writes atomically and never writes what its parser rejects. The reader seeks by the block size array; `Header::check_file_length` and each decoder's exact-size check refuse a file whose sizes are wrong. [CI1, CI4, CI5, CY2]

ARCHIVED (wording before the edit; superseded in part by Note GQ, 2026-11-04)
- Edit source and documents: `pick_source` compares roots ignoring path spelling and never takes the edit mod's own copy or any `sdc NIF Edits` folder. An autosave is deleted only when this session holds it; a session stays unsaved until its save succeeds; a root change waits for the live edit to move (else blocked with the reason, retried when that file changes); the newer of autosave and folder document wins. [CV1, GD11, GD12, GD13, GD20, GD21, GD24, GD27, GD28]

ARCHIVED (wording before the edit; superseded in part by Note GQ, 2026-11-04)
- Meshes list: picking a mod never deselects; a reload keeps the picked mod while it has NIFs and is not derived, else Any mod, and reselects a NIF picked under Any mod once the store settles. Wins hides under Any mod; Overridden lists every losing copy; Conflicted is `n_copies > 1`; Problems is a problem or an LE mesh. Search matches path (no `meshes/`) or mod, ASCII case-insensitive, `\` as `/`; the texture chip (`users_of_texture`) combines with it; "Show in Meshes" sets Any mod, clears search and chips. Row chips list warnings first; "In game" is short, full text as its AccessKit name. [BT5, GC4, GC6, GC7, GC8, GC9, GC10, GC16, GC17, GC19, GC20]

ARCHIVED (wording before the edit; superseded in part by Note GQ, 2026-11-04)
- `settle` compiles the keys the pool already took; `set_material` evicts every texture-less missing entry and keeps decode-error entries; a replaced model load drops its queued shader compiles. [BT1, BT2, CX1, CV24]

- The bent layer's AO source, in order: raw AO (R), `_orm` (R), `_rmaos`/`_rfaos` (B), read only for `bent` in `ao_blend` with `rnm.bent.ao = true`, else uniform weight. The manifest role carries the channel (`bent.ao.r`, `bent.ao.b`), so swapping a byte-identical file between them re-encodes the normal. [W9, AL4, W16]
